# Watts Linkage Simulator
Designing a linkage requires high precision, especially in linkages such as Watts which are used in automobiles and trains for suspension and prevent drift. Here in this project a designer can accurately simulate and design a linkage of the desired length and perform position, velocity, and acceleration analysis over it. The user can also compute the instantaneous values of these observations for further study.
